#### Disable Email Communication

Disable all email communication when the flowing settings are set to Yes.

 - Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > System > Mail Sending Settings > Disable Email Communications (system/smpt/disable)
 - Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > Email Catcher > General > Enable Email Catcher (emailcatcher/general/enabled)
 - Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > Email Catcher > General > Disable Email Sending (emailcatcher/general/smtp_disable)

#### Log Emails

If the module is enabled all emails which are sent will be logged in the database so the Admin User can always check how the email is displayed and if it is created.

These sent emails can be found in the Admin Panel:

 - System > Tools > Email Catcher


Enabled through the following setting:

 - Stores > Settings > Configuration > Advanced > Email Catcher > General > Enable Email Catcher (emailcatcher/general/enabled)

#### Whitelist email templates

In the module settings, a whitelist filter can be applied. The emails sent with the selected templates will be ignored by the module, and will be sent.
